change graph to a map not linkedlist

try and only use word - have a map of word - vertex

remove - not only remove from xml, nodes, but also the adjacency lists

in graph - finsih off removeVertex properly



create a string to pass to marc that sets up and empty graphml file
test parsing on empty file


graph should be a map not a linked list - string to vertex 

two mappings - string and index?

at the moment the problem parsing is caused by get last vertex
