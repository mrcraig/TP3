at the moment all nodes being saved in memory -

could also create methods to parse it everytime a method 
is called, and then have the option of either, depending 
on how big the xml file is



if xml file is empty, put in tags


change graph format - use index - linkedlist by index, or map?


get last index 


create consectutive index in memory?

would like to keep xml and memory consistent so can use same index for data structure
currently, nodes are removed, leaving gaps
new nodes are added at the top








change graph to a map not linkedlist

try and only use word - have a map of word - vertex
